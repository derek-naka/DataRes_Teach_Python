# DataRes_Teach_Python

This repository has all of the examples and visualizations talked about during the meetings.  I've also included all of the csv files that I've used for the projects in case you want to edit the code for yourself.

Teaching_Python_EDA.ipynb contains information about different types of visualizations: bar graphs, pie plots, histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, etc. In addition, has the code for other, more advanced visualizations such as facet-graphs, correlation heat maps, word clouds, and heat map of the US. 

Teaching_Python_ML.ipynb contains information regarding different types of machine learning.  It describes the difference between supervised & unsupervised machine learning and when to use them.  For supervised machine learning, it has examples for linear and non-linear regression. For unsupervised machine learning, it has examples for the elbow method (selecting # of cluster groups), PCA (clustering algorithm), T-SNE (clustering algorithm), and K-NN (select # of reference points).
